              My name is Muxtasar Otaxanova, a passionate and motivated web
              developer with a solid foundation in front-end technologies
              including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have successfully
              completed training in these technologies and am currently
              expanding my skills by learning Node.js to become a full-stack
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth, and I am
              currently preparing to begin teaching web development at ALgoritm
              Education Center in the near future. Sharing knowledge and helping
              others grow in the tech field is something I deeply care about.
              Outside of coding, I enjoy creating videos and reading books,
              which help me stay creative and inspired. Iâ€™m excited to take on
              new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects that make a
              positive impact.
